<p>Lewis Carroll makes Humpty Dumpty an idiot, and he does it on purpose. To fully understand Humpty Dumpty, one must first understand who author Lewis Carroll really was.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cf3ebc1-1a24-437f-8b14-9290156fcdb6_723x417.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cf3ebc1-1a24-437f-8b14-9290156fcdb6_723x417.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cf3ebc1-1a24-437f-8b14-9290156fcdb6_723x417.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cf3ebc1-1a24-437f-8b14-9290156fcdb6_723x417.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cf3ebc1-1a24-437f-8b14-9290156fcdb6_723x417.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1cf3ebc1-1a24-437f-8b14-9290156fcdb6_723x417.png" width="723" height="417" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1cf3ebc1-1a24-437f-8b14-9290156fcdb6_723x417.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:417,&quot;width&quot;:723,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;The Chancellor's Humpty Dumpty “pension” - Prime&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="The Chancellor's Humpty Dumpty “pension” - Prime" title="The Chancellor's Humpty Dumpty “pension” - Prime" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cf3ebc1-1a24-437f-8b14-9290156fcdb6_723x417.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cf3ebc1-1a24-437f-8b14-9290156fcdb6_723x417.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cf3ebc1-1a24-437f-8b14-9290156fcdb6_723x417.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cf3ebc1-1a24-437f-8b14-9290156fcdb6_723x417.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Lewis Carroll's real name was Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. He had been at Oxford only two days when he received a summons home. His mother had died of "inflammation of the brain" – perhaps meningitis or a stroke – at the age of 47 in 1851. </p><p>Carroll would begin and end his life as a Lecturer in Mathematics at Christ Church of Oxford Unversity, something his father did decades earlier. Unfortunately, when his father, Charles Dodgson decided to get married and have a family, he was no longer able to hold his position as Lecturer in Christ Church.</p><div id="youtube2-Orl-kMmRigw" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;Orl-kMmRigw&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Orl-kMmRigw?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p><em>(Jump to 1:07:00ish for the Humpty Dumpty part)</em></p><p>Interestingly enough, Rothenberg showed that truly remarkable creative children often have parents with unfulfilled creative wishes, which they somehow pass onto their children.</p><p>In a lot of ways, Lewis Carroll's success signifies the completion of his father's aspirations.</p><div><hr></div><h2>In Chess Terms</h2><p>Like with all characters in Through the looking Glass, Humpty Dumpty is a chess piece. Specifically, Humpty Dumpty is a Red Rook. Rooks in Through the Looking Glass represent communicators and communication channels, just like Tweedlee and Tweedledum.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Janusian Intelligence</h2><p>Martin Gardner, renowned magician, puzzle-maker, and author of The Annotated Alice, sees things clearly. </p><p>"Humpty Dumpty is a philologist and philosopher skilled primarily in linguistic matters. Perhaps Carroll is suggesting here that such types, exceedingly plentiful both then and now in the Oxford area, are seldom gifted mathematically." - Gardner</p><p>Humpty Dumpty is similar to the Reporters on either side of a political debate. They're incredibly intelligent when it comes to wordplay and semantics, yet are terribly feeble when it comes to logic and math and in fact get upset when math andsss logic are used to verify the validity of their arguments. Both sides are victims of the same hypocrisy.</p><p>Even the most well-read scholars of our time are uncertain about the nature of reality. When Alice meets the Unicorn, he provides her with the only solid footing in reality she can expect in such a backwards land.</p><div><hr></div><p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1528553387154980866">Reality is a dish best served cold.</a></p><div><hr></div><p><em>Through The Looking-Glass EXPLAINED uncovers the hidden algorithms that underlie Lewis Carroll’s greatest work.
