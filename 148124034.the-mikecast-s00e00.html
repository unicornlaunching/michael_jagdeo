<h1>And always remember: don’t talk to strangers.</h1><p>That’s what mom said to me before I left the house. I was 14 years old, on my way to Karate class at the YMCA here in Toronto. The classes were at night, and so sometimes I’d get home close to eleven in the pitch dark. </p><p>It seems crazy to think that I was traveling all alone back then at such a young age, but Toronto was a different place back then.</p><p>Today, it’s my job to talk to strangers. Wherever I go, people end up putting me in chrage of sales revenue, growth, strategy, partnerships, all that stuff. And so, it’s my job to risk rejection. It’s my job to cold call. It’s my job to create companies out of people who may not all see eye to eye. I was terrible at it 20 years ago, and in a lot of ways, I’m terrible at it now. But I’m less terrible at it now, and given that most people are afraid to sell, you don’t have to have a great batting average if nobody else is willing to step up to the plate, ya know what I’m sayin?</p><p>Today’s MikeCast - S00E00 - reflects the state I find myself in…my job is to reject my mom’s advice, so to speak. My job is to talk to strangers. The only problem is…talking to strangers still makes me nervous. Maybe problem is the wrong word…and that’s what I talked to myself about today on the MikeCast S00E00.</p><h1>THE MIKECAST S00E00 CLIPS</h1><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://x.com/attractfund1ng/status/1822944671334637810" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee41654f-d9b8-4ba9-ba68-f6d0274bcb7a_1624x1504.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee41654f-d9b8-4ba9-ba68-f6d0274bcb7a_1624x1504.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee41654f-d9b8-4ba9-ba68-f6d0274bcb7a_1624x1504.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee41654f-d9b8-4ba9-ba68-f6d0274bcb7a_1624x1504.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ee41654f-d9b8-4ba9-ba68-f6d0274bcb7a_1624x1504.jpeg" width="1456" height="1348" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ee41654f-d9b8-4ba9-ba68-f6d0274bcb7a_1624x1504.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1348,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:379574,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/attractfund1ng/status/1822944671334637810&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee41654f-d9b8-4ba9-ba68-f6d0274bcb7a_1624x1504.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee41654f-d9b8-4ba9-ba68-f6d0274bcb7a_1624x1504.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee41654f-d9b8-4ba9-ba68-f6d0274bcb7a_1624x1504.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee41654f-d9b8-4ba9-ba68-f6d0274bcb7a_1624x1504.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><h2>Situational Personality</h2><h4>"To allow yourself to be a lion when it's time to be a lion, and a deer when it's time to be a deer." <br>- Mike Jagdeo</h4><p>Bible: "There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens." - Ecclesiastes 3:1</p><p>Islam: "Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves." - Quran 13:11</p><p>Tao Te Ching: "Do the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small." - Chapter 63</p><div><hr></div><h2>Who’s That Talking Inside Your Head?</h2><h4>"If you find yourself second guessing yourself, you should ask yourself, who exactly is second guessing?"<br>- Mike Jagdeo</h4><p>Bible: "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding." - Proverbs 3:5</p><p>Islam: "What is with you will perish, but what is with Allah is enduring." - Quran 16:96</p><p>Tao Te Ching: "He who knows does not speak.
