It’s probably why there’s so much mythology and fake news about it.</p><p>Sales is a process of problem-solving. If you can solve a problem that’s important to your client, you’ll give yourself the highest probability of success. Sales can be a numbers game, and so it’s important to make the most of every call and interaction you make. Most people quit sales because they can’t get someone to say yes. It’s emotional, and that’s why the career is so lucrative.</p><div><hr></div><h2>The Problem With The Opportunity</h2><p>The problem is, when you call a prospect, you don’t have their permission to ask them about their problems. After all, why should they trust you?</p><p>When I first started out in sales, I didn’t know how to start the call. I didn’t know what to say first. I’d just call and ramble and slur my words and talk to fast and they wouldn’t hear anything I was saying. In truth, I was afraid. I was afraid that I wouldn’t know the answers to their questions and seem like an idiot.</p><p>Once I found a script that made me comfortable with calling in the first place, things got A LOT EASIER.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Gaining Their Permission To Ask About Their Problems</h2><p>Here’s a script that worked for me the other day.</p><blockquote><p>Hello,</p><p>My name is Michael - we haven’t spoken before so I’ll take some of the mystery out of my call.</p><p>I represent a company that upskills Electronic Security Techs.</p><p>But before I say anything else, this is a sales call, so I don’t want to just assume I have your permission to continue.</p><p>[WAIT FOR ANSWER]</p></blockquote><p>For me, I always avoided sales calls because I didn’t know what to say in the beginning. Once I found a beginning that worked for my personality, one that involved an interaction instead of a monologue, things changed for me. I no longer felt uncomfortable wondering if the other person was about to hang up the call…and I was always afraid of them hanging up on me.</p><div><hr></div><h2>The Next Step</h2><p>Once you have their permission to ask them questions, you can begin taking the next steps in the sales process. Sales is a process of problem solving, and we’re going to dive into the four-step sales problem solving process to rank order their problems in terms of costs and revenues in the next post made popular by Rackham called SPIN.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Gimme The Science</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8f9ef94-e2ec-404e-8aaa-831641711ff6_1082x678.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8f9ef94-e2ec-404e-8aaa-831641711ff6_1082x678.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8f9ef94-e2ec-404e-8aaa-831641711ff6_1082x678.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8f9ef94-e2ec-404e-8aaa-831641711ff6_1082x678.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8f9ef94-e2ec-404e-8aaa-831641711ff6_1082x678.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d8f9ef94-e2ec-404e-8aaa-831641711ff6_1082x678.jpeg" width="1082" height="678" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d8f9ef94-e2ec-404e-8aaa-831641711ff6_1082x678.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:678,&quot;width&quot;:1082,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Speak to the Crocodile Brain to Market &amp; Sell Building Materials  Effectively | Visual Construction Marketing by Jason Yana&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Speak to the Crocodile Brain to Market &amp; Sell Building Materials  Effectively | Visual Construction Marketing by Jason Yana" title="Speak to the Crocodile Brain to Market &amp; Sell Building Materials  Effectively | Visual Construction Marketing by Jason Yana" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8f9ef94-e2ec-404e-8aaa-831641711ff6_1082x678.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8f9ef94-e2ec-404e-8aaa-831641711ff6_1082x678.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8f9ef94-e2ec-404e-8aaa-831641711ff6_1082x678.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8f9ef94-e2ec-404e-8aaa-831641711ff6_1082x678.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>When you make a sales call, you put yourself in the position where you’re offering an opportunity to your client.
