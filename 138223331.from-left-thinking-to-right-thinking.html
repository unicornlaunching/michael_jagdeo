They emphasize the value of self-reflection, taking responsibility for one's actions, and gaining insight from past experiences. The law of cause and effect is discussed as the fundamental law of the universe, and the speakers argue that it is impersonal and not dependent on any particular individual or circumstance. They suggest that the law of cause and effect can be used to improve one's life and create the results desired. The speakers also emphasize the importance of understanding and using the laws in shaping our effects or results. They point out that our abundance in life is determined by our consciousness, ideas, frame of reference, and belief system, and that we can only receive what our minds are capable of accepting. They suggest that positive thinking alone is insufficient and that right thinking, based in truth and not illusion, is the most important thing. They also argue that power is neutral and simply the force of creation, which can be used to create anything that we want in our lives. The speakers also discuss the idea that true freedom in life is found by being aware of one's beliefs and thoughts and taking responsibility for one's life. They suggest that our beliefs and past experiences can limit our potential, and that our thoughts and choices can either perpetuate those limitations or help us overcome them. Overall, the speakers stress the importance of maintaining a positive mindset, understanding the laws of the universe, and taking responsibility for our actions and beliefs in order to achieve lasting success and happiness in life.</p><p>See more</p><h3><strong><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=3600">01:00:00</a> - <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=7200">02:00:00</a></strong></h3><p>In the section of "Beyond Positive Thinking" by Dr. Robert Anthony, the speaker discusses the importance of self-evaluation and how it can help us understand our limitations and gain clarity on our true selves.

Dr. Anthony believes that our inner beliefs are the fundamental alignment of our experiences and that what we perceive in the world is only a reflection of our own beliefs.

He argues that we deny ourselves riches and health if we compare ourselves to others and believe that we are not committed to the same path as them. He believes that it is important to understand the temporary nature of life and the importance of separating the performer from the performance. Achieving self-discovery and realizing thetaures of our life requires that we understand our inner selves and learn to observe our mistakes without judgment. People often give away their power because they do not want to take responsibility for their lives, but it is important to understand that those who do not take control of their lives will ultimately be controlled by others. Dr. Anthony argues that the key to changing our world is to change our relationship with it, rather than attempting to change the world itself. He points out that our inner beliefs are the fundamental alignment of our experiences and that what we perceive in the world is only a reflection of our own beliefs.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=3900">01:05:00</a></strong> In this section, Dr. Robert Anthony argues that in order to create lasting change in one's life, it is essential to look inward and evaluate what is currently happening. The changes that we make in our outer lives will only cause the same experience again if we do not address the inner cause of the problem. He goes on to discuss the concept of self-evaluation and how it can help us understand our limitations and gain clarity on our true selves. Dr. Anthony also talks about the importance of being present in the present moment, and how unhappiness is caused by comparison to past or future situations. He suggests that people who believe they can change their level of happiness by changing their exterior scenery are making a mistake, and that the true source of happiness lies within ourselves. Dr. Anthony concludes that self-talk is a process that shapes our personalities and attitudes, and that we must control what we think in order to live our best lives.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=4200">01:10:00</a></strong> In this section, Dr. Robert Anthony discusses the dangers of holding onto opinions, attitudes, and beliefs that no longer serve us. He advises examining our beliefs regularly to avoid blocking out information and lying to ourselves. The human brain stores our self-image and builds it with our self-talk, which can reinforce or modify our beliefs. Self-talk also affects our performance and behavior, in accordance with our subconscious picture of reality. The sure-enough principle recognizes that our level of expectation determines the outcome. Dr. Anthony warns that the self-reinforcing cycle works like a machine, and our self-talk constantly reinforces our self-image, beliefs, and performance, making it difficult to behave in a different way.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=4500">01:15:00</a></strong> In this section of the video, Dr. Robert Anthony talks about the importance of self-talk and affirmative statements in regulating one's performance and forming a positive self-image. He emphasizes that negative self-talk can reinforce a negative self-image, which in turn can lead to poor performance and will only continue to reinforce poor performance. To correct this, he suggests to stop negative self-talk and to follow up with positive and immediate feedback to one's subconscious. Furthermore, he emphasizes that the key to maintaining or building self-esteem is to visualize what one wants their performance to look like, and to stop picturing, thinking about, and talking about what one is trying to avoid when their performance pleases them. He also stresses the importance of associating oneself with people one feels worthy of being with, whether in business or in relationships.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=4800">01:20:00</a></strong> In this section, Dr. Robert Anthony discusses the power of self-talk in shaping our image of ourselves, limiting our potential and preventing us from achieving our goals. He explains how changing our self-image is the key to unlocking our true potential and improving our performance in all areas of life. According to Dr. Anthony, our self-image is a belief about our current capabilities and what is expected of us, which is automatically reenacted through our behavior and performance. The crucial step in changing our image is self-talk, combined with visualization. Through this process, our subconscious can resolve conflicts and create what we are thinking about and visualizing, ultimately expanding our comfort zones and leading to real growth and change.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=5100">01:25:00</a></strong> In this section of the video, Dr. Robert Anthony discusses the power of attitudes in determining success or failure. Attitudes are dominant beliefs that can either support or hinder our progress towards our goals. They shape the image of reality that our subconscious creates, and our actions are based on these habits of thought. Dr. Anthony emphasizes the importance of examining our attitudes to see if they are relevant to our success and whether they align with our goals. He suggests that we can change our attitudes by controlling our self-talk, using affirmations, and visualizing the desired outcome. This section highlights the role that attitudes play in shaping our lives and the importance of cultivating positive and empowering attitudes for achieving our goals.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=5400">01:30:00</a></strong> In this section of the YouTube video, Dr. Robert Anthony emphasizes the importance of controlling our imagery through directed self-talk to achieve our desired results. He states that our subconscious creative mechanism knows exactly where we are in time and space in relationship to our target, and any result we are trying to achieve. If we get off course, negative feedback will motivate us to stay on course, stimulating our creative energy and drive. The goal must be clearly and specifically defined, and we must control our mental picture to bring about our desired end result. The trap of forcing change is avoided by recognizing that we are self-made people, both in success and failure, and that we have control over our success and failure. To move constructively toward our desired end result, we must stop saying "I have to" and instead say "I choose to," relying on promises to ourselves to become powerful individuals.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=5700">01:35:00</a></strong> In this section of the video, Dr. Robert Anthony discusses the power of self-talk and imagery in achieving one's goals. He asserts that human beings do not always behave in accordance with the truth, but rather in accordance with their perception of reality. Our awareness, or our perception of reality, is shaped by our experiences, impressions, and attitudes from birth. To be successful in life, we must constantly work to change and expand our level of awareness, or our perception of reality, in order to see opportunities and solutions that may not be readily apparent. Dr. Anthony encourages listeners to question their beliefs and assumptions, and to consciously choose their thoughts and actions based on a more expanded and accurate view of reality.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=6000">01:40:00</a></strong> In this section of the video, Dr. Robert Anthony and Joe Vitalie discuss the importance of setting goals before being able to achieve them. According to Dr. Anthony, the natural filtering device of our brain and mind functions together to aid us in obtaining our goals. However, in order for this filter to function correctly, we must know exactly what we want. By determining what our values and attitudes are, we can filter out any information that is not important to us or poses a threat to our survival. This will allow us to become more aware of valuable opportunities and information that will help us achieve our goals. The interplay between our brain and mind functions is crucial in any success.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=6300">01:45:00</a></strong> In this section of the video, Dr. Robert Anthony discusses the importance of believing in a goal first before trying to find information or opportunities related to that goal. The necessary information will only become apparent once you know what you are looking for. This example can be applied to various aspects of life, such as finding clients, jobs, or people with whom one wants to be involved. The video explains that soon as one decides what they want, they will see examples of that feat everywhere. For instance, a person interested in a particular brand of automobile will suddenly see that brand in every advertisement or parked on the highway nearby. It is crucial to define what one wants before finding opportunities, as information may not get through if one does not know what they are looking for. Knowing exactly what clients or customers want is crucial in helping them obtain it. Without knowing what their customers or clients want, individuals will not have the necessary information on how to help them. To be an excellent conversationalist, one must offer value to the other person before they can get through. Outlining what one wants can increase an individual's awareness of how to help others attain it. The video highlights that individuals are often limited by their thinking, leading to missed opportunities or anxiety. It is essential to remain open to new information and use rationalization to explain one's logic or reasoning. Rationalization refers to gathering people and information to support one's opinions or justifications for their actions. It is crucial to listen objectively to others' ideas and opinions to gain insight into different solutions. Ultimately, believing in a goal first can have a significant impact on the outcome, as it allows individuals to focus on finding solutions rather than dwelling on problems. It is also essential to be mindful of clustering and avoid blocking out useful information by focusing only on what confirms one's beliefs. In essence, the choice is always there, and it is up to the individual to choose what they want and pursue the solution with confidence.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=6600">01:50:00</a></strong> In this section of the video, Dr. Robert Anthony discusses the importance of using one's creative energy not only to pursue new opportunities but also to overcome challenges and setbacks. He explains that fear often causes people to retreat or give up, but using creative energy to figure out a way forward can lead to greater success. He encourages people to put their energy into making things happen rather than focusing on what things are not available or doable. Additionally, Dr. Anthony emphasizes the importance of self-worth and self-esteem in attracting opportunities and building relationships. He encourages people to accept suggestions and criticism from others and to recognize the value of learning from others, regardless of their background or expertise. Finally, Dr. Anthony encourages people to focus on the end result and not become too attached to a particular approach or outcome.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=6900">01:55:00</a></strong> In this section of the video, Dr. Robert Anthony, read by Joe Vitale, discusses the importance of focusing on one's goals and aspirations rather than dwelling on one's limitations. He emphasizes that the biggest challenge for a leader is not what the leader believes, but rather what the leader can get others to believe. The speaker argues that people act in accordance with the truth as they perceive it, and if their perception of reality is faulty, they will come up with logical reasons why something won't work or can't be done. To overcome this, a leader must help others change their level of expectation and teach them how to create from an idea. Dr. Anthony encourages parents, mates, and leaders to lead others to believe that they can do more than they think they are capable of. He notes that people today are too sophisticated to blindly follow a leader, and they want logical reasons for their beliefs. The speaker advises that one cannot ask others to blindly follow them but must teach them how to create from an idea using tools they are learning. He emphasizes that if individuals or others around them are telling you that something can't be done or that they can't see how it can be done, they are giving their power away. To reclaim this power, one must surround themselves with people who find solutions, are not always looking for reasons why things can't be done, and believe that things can be done.</p></li></ul><h3><strong><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=7200">02:00:00</a> - <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=9000">02:30:00</a></strong></h3><p>The speaker in the YouTube video discussed the role of belief and mindset in achieving goals and achieving a happy and satisfying life.

He emphasizes that believing before seeing is the natural process of creation, and it is through our belief in our capabilities and power that we can accomplish tasks that others view as unrealistic or impossible. The speaker highlights how our mindset plays a crucial role in determining our results and points out the three main beliefs that prevent us from being happy and satisfied in life – believing that what we don't have is better, having more is always better, and that getting what we want will make us happy. These beliefs are often the root cause of our unhappiness and stress, as they focus more on problem-solving rather than living in the present moment. To achieve a better quality of life, the speaker suggests we should flow with life instead of flowing against it by allowing our inner experiences to determine our happiness and satisfaction, regardless of external circumstances.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=7500">02:05:00</a></strong> In this section, Dr. Robert Anthony and Joe Vitale discuss the idea that happiness is an inside out experience and that outside factors cannot make us happy. They explain that many people believe that success is achieved through having, doing, and then being. However, this method only undermines our true happiness. They also mention that life flows from being into doing and then having and emphasize the importance of being happy and satisfied from the inside out in order to get what we want. They argue that getting what we want will not change our lives and that we need to learn to enjoy what we have in the present moment instead of constantly striving for more and focusing on the future. Overall, the message is to shift our perspective on life and learn to appreciate what we have in order to achieve true happiness and fulfillment.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=7800">02:10:00</a></strong> In this section, Dr. Robert Anthony discusses the idea that achieving your goals does not necessarily change who you are as a person, and that true success comes from the act of participating in the journey towards your goals. He emphasizes the importance of setting clear intentions and having a clear picture of what you want to create in your life. He also talks about the standard mistake people make when setting their New Year's resolutions, which is focusing on the negative behavior they want to stop rather than the positive outcome they want to achieve. He argues that goal setting is key to success, and that individuals who don't take the time to establish goals for their most important journey, their own life, will never truly achieve the freedom they desire.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=8100">02:15:00</a></strong> In this section of the YouTube video, Dr. Robert Anthony and Joe Vitale discuss the power of choice in shaping our lives. Everything in life, except for death and living until we die, is a choice that we make. Our decisions determine our experiences and the paths we take in life. To effectively make choices, it's important to acknowledge our current situation and understand where we want to be. This involves observing our patterns of thought and being honest with ourselves about where we are. By choosing where we want to go, we can create anything that we want and experience true freedom.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=8400">02:20:00</a></strong> In this section from a YouTube video by Dr. Robert Anthony, read by Joe Vitale, the importance of clear and defined goals is emphasized. Goal-setting is simply a matter of making choices about where one wants to go, and if one does not have a clear destination in mind, they will likely end up somewhere else. Writing one's own script means creating a definite, workable plan with a clear path for success. This imprints the plan on the subconscious, helping to eliminate obstacles, distractions, and interruptions. By reviewing what has been written, the motivation for achieving the goal is reinforced, and the plan serves as a yardstick for progress. It is essential to identify the benefits of the goal, as this motivates the individual to remain committed and willing to pay the necessary price to achieve it. The critical difference between those who make it and those who do not lies in their desire for rewards and their ability to identify specific benefits upon goal achievement. Defining a goal with an inherent or built-in reward ensures that there is a motivation to action and helps solve any problem in life.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=8700">02:25:00</a></strong> In this section of the YouTube video, Dr. Robert Anthony suggests that when one sets a goal for themselves, their subconscious mind may try to protect them from an imaginary loss. This can result in feelings of fear and doubt, and a lack of motivation to achieve the goal. Joe Vitale reads this section from the video. To overcome this obstacle, Vitale suggests that individuals must center their thoughts on the goal rather than the obstacles and roadblocks in their way. He emphasizes the importance of being realistic about the possible obstacles and roadblocks, and to write them down in a list as complete as possible. Vitale also touches on the common mistake of glossing over obstacles and roadblocks, and encourages individuals to be aware of these so they can find the solutions. He promotes the power of knowledge and suggests that solutions are always available. Finally, Vitale suggests that individuals must be open and responsive to the answers, and that time is an important factor in achieving goals. He advises individuals to set deadlines for their endeavors. Overall, Vitale encourages individuals to focus on their goals and believe in their ability to achieve them, even in the face of obstacles and challenges.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5IDsgcF2k&amp;t=9000">02:30:00</a></strong> In this section of the video, Dr. Robert Anthony discusses the importance of setting specific and achievable goals. He states that a goal should have a deadline attached to it, and that the deadline should be the slave and not the master. To achieve a goal, one must weigh the benefits, rewards, obstacles, and solutions before committing to it. Dr. Anthony emphasizes the importance of positive feedback and keeping track of accomplishments in a designated notebook. This process not only increases motivation, but also helps one to obtain the things they truly want in life.</p></li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p>
