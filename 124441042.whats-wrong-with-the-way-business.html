Theoretically, you would have somebody teaching you accounting who was an accountant, not just studied the theory of accounting.</p><p>Someone is going to be teaching our pilots at the program we have in Peterborough well, obviously how to fly a plane. People who teach fire protection services are people who are former Toronto Fire department. But you'd be surprised how many people who teach business have never run a business for a substantial period of time.</p><p>And the party the reason is because the competitiveness to become a professor is such that in order to teach now at the college level, you pretty much have to have a PhD to get hired on. Obviously you have to have a PhD 100% to get university level, but at the minimum would be an MBA. I got hired on as a full time prof without having neither a master's or a PhD.</p><p>But the subject that I taught, international business, I did international business for 1516, 1718 years. So that was accepted as such. But the process usually is so time consuming in order to get those credentials to compete for the job interview.</p><p>And they have a little score checklist, bachelor's degree, master's degree, how many years teaching experience, how many part time years teaching experience, et cetera. They have any experience curriculum writing and they've written any peer reviewed journal articles. Yada yada.</p><p>Not one fucking question about did you ever run a business? So that can be kind of frustrating because you're standing in class talking about old personal selling chapter number 14, and you're going down the list of of how to handle objections and you've actually never done that. Have you become a teacher? Kicking and screaming because I didn't want to be a teacher.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6a1ddff-169c-499e-8cdb-a7f082e84853_512x512" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6a1ddff-169c-499e-8cdb-a7f082e84853_512x512 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6a1ddff-169c-499e-8cdb-a7f082e84853_512x512 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6a1ddff-169c-499e-8cdb-a7f082e84853_512x512 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6a1ddff-169c-499e-8cdb-a7f082e84853_512x512 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e6a1ddff-169c-499e-8cdb-a7f082e84853_512x512" width="1200" height="1200" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e6a1ddff-169c-499e-8cdb-a7f082e84853_512x512&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:512,&quot;width&quot;:512,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-large" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6a1ddff-169c-499e-8cdb-a7f082e84853_512x512 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6a1ddff-169c-499e-8cdb-a7f082e84853_512x512 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6a1ddff-169c-499e-8cdb-a7f082e84853_512x512 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6a1ddff-169c-499e-8cdb-a7f082e84853_512x512 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">frustrated business person learning in a lecture hall</figcaption></figure></div><p></p>
