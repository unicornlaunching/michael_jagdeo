<p>You don’t need to learn how to code…we have computers for that, now.</p><p>With the advent of ChatGPT and CodePilot, more and more people are getting more and more done <em>without</em> learning how to code.</p><p>With Big Tech laying of 50,000 people AT THE SAME TIME they’re investing billions in AI, the TikTok Aristocracy has declared the end of labour as we know it.</p><p>But I think back to Zoom and it gives me pause, because <em>Zoom shouldn’t exist</em>.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Zoom Shouldn’t Exist</h2><p>Think about it: when Zoom was introduced, we already had Skype and Google Meetings. We even had Periscope and a host of other apps to make video calls.</p><p>Yet, here we are, using Zoom. Zoom shouldn’t exist. There should have been Venture Capitalists rejecting the notion that the world needed YET ANOTHER video chat app.</p><p>Yet, here we are, using Zoom. And the fact that Zoom exists should give us hope.</p><p>As much as it might seem that everything has already been built, we’d be reminded that Zoom exists. In a crowded marketplace where all of the FAANGs have mature products, an upstart with a singular vision can still strike it rich.</p><p>But it will take customer intimacy to make that happen.</p><p>Calendly is another product that shouldn’t exist. We already had Google Calendars and Outlook Calendars before that…yet Calendly exists.</p><p>Why did Zoom &amp; Calendly win? They won on User Experience.</p><div><hr></div><h2>The UX is the Product</h2><p>Calendly allowed people to book a meeting that didn’t conflict with their other meetings through a handful of clicks; that user experience beat out Microsoft Outlook and Google Calendars.</p><p>Zoom allowed people to send a link to join a meeting. That simple change propelled them to the most used video app.</p><p>Heck, Amazon wins because they SHIP faster and more reliably than anyone else. People complain about the shopping interface but NEVER complain about not getting their packages.</p><p>So, in a world where code is a commodity, customer intimacy is at a premium.</p><div><hr></div><div class="pullquote"><p>In a world where your brand, products, and services are the same as everyone else’s, it’s only your sales process that differentiates you. <br>- The Challenger Sales Model</p></div><p>And what’s the most important part of the sales process?

Of course you do…but not for the reason people tell you. You need to learn how to code so you can develop prototypes by yourself. It used to take hundreds of thousands of dollars to develop prototypes…now you can do it on your own if you know a bit of code.</p>
