Play the person, not the cards. It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.</p><p>Given that most jobs are filled by. te friends and families of current employees, you must become friends with people who work for the companies that you want to work for.</p><p>As we’ve mentioned before, there are many people sending out 100s of job applications without ever hearing back. Does that mean that companies aren’t hiring? </p><p>No. Most jobs are filled before they’re ever posted online. That’s why you need to create relationships with people who hear about new job opportunities FIRST. And the people who hear about new job opportunities FIRST are Hiring Managers and their employees.</p><p>In this post, you’ll learn about the main sites that you can use to generate Earning Power.</p><div><hr></div><h2>The Top Places To Attract Paying Gigs &amp; Jobs</h2><h3>Linkedin</h3><p>Linkedin is one of the easiest ways to make yourself known to Hiring Managers. That said, employees and hiring managers aren’t as honest as they might be because when you speak on Linkedin, you are also implicitly speaking on behalf of the company you work for. Nobody wants to get fired for posting something edgy on Linkedin. So, while Linkedin is a great place to discover information about Hiring Managers and network with employees, it shouldn’t be your only way to connect with them.</p><h3>Twitter</h3><p>Twitter has quietly become one of the most powerful places to find talent on the planet. Many employees create anonymous aka alt accounts in order to say how they really feel, separate from the scrutiny they might otherwise face on Linkedin. Since there can be a degree of anonymity on Twitter, Hiring Managers and Employees are often MORE personable and friendly when compared to Linkedin. Having a Twitter account in today’s job market is a very powerful tool. </p><h3>Clubhouse</h3><p>Clubhouse is another powerful way to meet Hiring Managers and Employers in a semi-casual setting. Touch the heart before you touch the hand. People buy from you because they like you and they trust you. Gain their trust and they’ll begin considering you for opportunities quite naturally. We’d rather hire someone slightly under-qualified that they trust than an expert that they don’t trust.</p><h3>Indeed</h3><p>Indeed is a popular job-hunting app with tons of jobs to apply to.</p><h3>Fiverr</h3><p>Fiverr is an OUTSTANDING way to attract your ideal customer. Many Hiring Managers and Employees frequent Fiverr in search of affordable alternatives to doing their job themselves. I even know someone who created a MASSIVE waiting list of paying customers by presenting his offering on Fiverr. Do NOT underestimate the quality of leads you can generate for your talents on Fiverr.</p><div><hr></div><p>Sign up for these services and start following the people at the companies you want to work for. Once you’ve done that, you’ll have completed the PASSIVE way of job hunting.</p><p>The next level in generating earning power is not just existing on platforms but INTERACTING with the Hiring Managers and Employees on those platforms. Once you learn how to savvily network with the right people who know about jobs before they’re ever posted, you’ll have a skill that few possess.</p><p>Once you’ve completed signing up for the services above, you’ll be ready for the next step: the sales conversation.</p><p><a href="https://digitalmercenary.substack.com/s/the-sales-conversation">The Sales Conversation</a></p><div
