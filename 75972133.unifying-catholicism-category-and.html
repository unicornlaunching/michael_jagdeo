<h2>Overview</h2><p>In this episode, the main character continues practicing Higher Reasoning, which is a form of meditation. He is able to repel darkness and defeat his enemies by using this meditation technique.</p><p>The concept of "higher reasoning" is similar to the Taoist concept of "emptiness," in that it is about understanding the connections and dependencies between things. This concept can be applied in everyday life, explaining that it is not about looking at things in a fixed or absolute way, but about embracing the uncertainty and chaos of existence.</p><div id="youtube2-mWLLZCMhddo" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;mWLLZCMhddo&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mWLLZCMhddo?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><div><hr></div><h2>1. Martyr-Driven Development</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWLLZCMhddo&amp;t=0">00:00:00</a> In this video, Daoist theologian Matios Berhe discusses how the language we use to describe concepts such as God, angels, and saints reflects our own understanding of those concepts. He goes on to say that the imagery and values that are ingrained in these concepts come from the martyrs, who were persecuted for their faith during the height of the Christian empire.</p><h2>2. Limit-Driven Development</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWLLZCMhddo&amp;t=300">00:05:00</a> The video discusses mathematics and how one can understand an equation by looking at the limit of the equation as well as the various possibilities that could have led to the equation. It goes on to say that in the same way that an image can be infinitely complex, so too is the universe.</p><h2>3. Hieroglyph-Driven Development</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWLLZCMhddo&amp;t=600">00:10:00</a> The video discusses the idea that higher order numerical representations are necessary to understand complex processes, including those involved in art and creativity. It notes that while it is possible to infer certain things about these processes from lower order representations, this is often not enough. The video makes the point that symbolic AI, which uses higher order representations, is necessary for truly understanding these processes.</p><h2>4. Matrix-Driven Development</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWLLZCMhddo&amp;t=900">00:15:00</a> The video discusses the concepts of higher reasoning, intuition, and the matrix of creation. It explains that intuition is a predetermined function that allows for the detection of aspects of reality that are not immediately available, and that higher reasoning is the ability to construct models of reality that are based on probability.</p><h2>5. Empty-Driven Development</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWLLZCMhddo&amp;t=1200">00:20:00</a> The video discusses how the concept of "higher reasoning" is similar to the Taoist concept of "emptiness," in that it is about understanding the connections and dependencies between things. The video also discusses how this concept can be applied in everyday life, explaining that it is not about looking at things in a fixed or absolute way, but about embracing the uncertainty and chaos of existence.</p><h2>6. Center-Driven Development</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWLLZCMhddo&amp;t=1500">00:25:00</a> The protagonist discusses how he has been fired from jobs in the past, but has never quit. He discusses how people who he considers weak are never the cause of any problems for him, but he does get frustrated when people project their own opinions onto him. He explains that he uses his own "truth" to respond to those who challenge him, instead of getting caught up in the negativity. He advises others who are seeking to be more centered in their lives to meditate and to practice understanding the shifting nature of reality.</p><h2>7. Functor-Driven Development</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWLLZCMhddo&amp;t=1800">00:30:00</a> Category theory is a mathematical theory that helps to formalize concepts in a way that allows for infinite flexibility in how they can be used. It is often used in fields such as mathematics, computer science, and philosophy.</p><h2>8. Platonic Solid-Driven Development</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWLLZCMhddo&amp;t=2100">00:35:00</a> This YouTube video discusses Plato's theory of Forms and how it relates to the idea of intuition. It argues that intuition is a result of understanding the principles behind Forms, and that when we introduce new information into our understanding of Forms, the intuitions we had previously are now more accurate.</p><h2>9. Chaos-Driven Development</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWLLZCMhddo&amp;t=2400">00:40:00</a> Category theory is a powerful mathematical tool that can be used to understand complex concepts. A video featuring Jade, a category theorist, discusses how a frame of reference is necessary to understand these concepts. Category theory is important for understanding the nature of chaos.</p><h2>10. Opposite-Driven Development</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWLLZCMhddo&amp;t=2700">00:45:00</a> These opposites arise automatically and are intrinsic to reality. The scale of the universe is unimaginable and even if one knew the traversal of butterflies' paths, they could only compute where it's going based on where it's been. One can't know where it's going, but they kind of can. This is probability. Christianity is Neoplatonic and it blows the mind of the protagonist. He hadn't heard that before and it made him reflect on his experiences within Catholicism. His Protestant friends would tell him different things. Some said it was just different, but it was dope because he did have a taste of it when he was young. His mother told him it wasn't Platonic, it was just different.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef85685b-0855-4191-9ad1-559836d397ba_2880x1800.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef85685b-0855-4191-9ad1-559836d397ba_2880x1800.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef85685b-0855-4191-9ad1-559836d397ba_2880x1800.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef85685b-0855-4191-9ad1-559836d397ba_2880x1800.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef85685b-0855-4191-9ad1-559836d397ba_2880x1800.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ef85685b-0855-4191-9ad1-559836d397ba_2880x1800.png" width="1456" height="910" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ef85685b-0855-4191-9ad1-559836d397ba_2880x1800.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:910,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1427864,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef85685b-0855-4191-9ad1-559836d397ba_2880x1800.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef85685b-0855-4191-9ad1-559836d397ba_2880x1800.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef85685b-0855-4191-9ad1-559836d397ba_2880x1800.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef85685b-0855-4191-9ad1-559836d397ba_2880x1800.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h2>11. Connection-Driven Development</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWLLZCMhddo&amp;t=3000">00:50:00</a> The Platonic tradition is a contemplative one that can be found across many faiths and traditions. It is not staring into the void, but rather contemplating the connections between all things. It is important to be fair in judging someone, as it is better to err on the side of letting a killer go free than to kill an innocent person.</p><h2>12. Unknown-Driven Development</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWLLZCMhddo&amp;t=3300">00:55:00</a> The Catechism says that you could almost argue that man was made to be a religious being in order seek the unknown, which leads to things like searches outside the frame in order to bring things to fruition. This principle is seen in active time and time again on the outside, both in the ways that the outsider was used as the cornerstone, and in the examples given of how things fall from the sky.</p><h2>13. Mercy-Driven Development</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWLLZCMhddo&amp;t=3600">01:00:00</a> In the video, destruction is supposed to be going to this city and telling them that their way of life is not living according to the way. However, Dao decides to run away instead, and ends up getting swallowed up by a well. After putting other people at risk, he eventually goes to the city and it is saved. Dao is upset that the city was not destroyed, and God shows him why he was wrong. In the end, Dao learns that love, mercy, and understanding are more important than fire and destruction.</p><h2>14. Higher-Reasoning-Driven Development</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWLLZCMhddo&amp;t=3900">01:05:00</a> In this episode, the main character continues practicing Higher Reasoning, which is a form of meditation. He is able to repel darkness and defeat his enemies by using this meditation technique.</p><div id="youtube2-mWLLZCMhddo" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;mWLLZCMhddo&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mWLLZCMhddo?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div>
