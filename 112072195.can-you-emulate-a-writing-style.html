<h2>ROBOTS WILL TAKE OUR JOBS –</h2><h2>LEAVING US TO FIND PURPOSE</h2><p>Humans are motivated by purpose.</p><div id="youtube2-640BQNxB5mc" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;640BQNxB5mc&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/640BQNxB5mc?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>So, why is it that our current economic infrastructure is built on survival? And, not purpose?</p><p>In 2009, Daniel H. Pink wrote a book on what motivates people to be high performers. Hint: It’s not money.</p><p>After going through over four decades of scientific research, Pink’s book Drive concluded that there are 3 key factors needed in order for people to feel fulfilled in their jobs:</p><ol><li><p>Mastery – Are there opportunities for growth and learning?</p></li><li><p>Autonomy – Is there freedom and control over their environment?</p></li><li><p>Purpose – Are they doing something that matters to them?</p></li></ol><p>Yet, despite these findings, our current job market often fails to provide these key motivators. Instead, we are often driven by the need to make a living and provide for our basic needs.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Finding Purpose in a Post-Automation World</h3><p>And now, as we enter the era of automation, the fear that robots will take our jobs and leave us without a purpose is becoming more and more prevalent. But is this fear justified? Or could this actually be an opportunity for us to shift our focus from survival to purpose?</p><p>It’s no secret that automation is becoming more prevalent in the workforce. In fact, a recent report from the McKinsey Global Institute found that up to 800 million jobs could be displaced by automation by 2030. And while this may seem like a daunting figure, it’s important to remember that automation is not a new phenomenon.</p><p>Throughout history, we have seen technology replace certain jobs while creating new opportunities in other areas. For example, the rise of the internet and e-commerce led to the decline of brick-and-mortar retail stores but also created new jobs in online marketing and logistics.</p><p>So, while there may be some disruption in the short-term, it’s important to remember that the long-term effects of automation are not entirely negative. In fact, automation could actually free up more time and resources for us to pursue our passions and find meaning in our lives.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Redefining Work and Success in the Age of Automation</h3><p>Imagine a world where the mundane tasks of our jobs are automated, leaving us with more time to focus on projects that truly matter to us. A world where we can use our creativity and problem-solving skills to make a difference in our communities and the world at large.</p><p>Of course, this is not to say that the transition to a more automated workforce will be easy or without its challenges. It’s important for governments, businesses, and individuals to work together to ensure that those who are displaced by automation are provided with the necessary support and resources to retrain and find new employment opportunities.</p><p>But ultimately, the shift towards automation could be a catalyst for us to redefine the purpose of work and find new ways to create value and meaning in our lives. So, instead of fearing the rise of the robots, let’s embrace the opportunities that lie ahead and work towards a future where purpose is at the forefront of our economic infrastructure.</p>
