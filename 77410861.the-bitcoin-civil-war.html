<h2>Bottom-Line Up-Front</h2><p>The Bitcoin Civil War is a conflict between those who support the Bitcoin currency and those who think it is a long-tail marketing ploy. The war began when China began to produce superior ASICs that made it difficult for Bitcoin miners to make a profit. The white paper that inspired the creation of Bitcoin explained how proof of work could solve the scalability, speed, and security trilemma, but a small group of people have successfully inserted themselves as guard nodes and are manipulating the network to their own ends.</p><div><hr></div><div id="youtube2-m1riWXUnA2k" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;m1riWXUnA2k&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/m1riWXUnA2k?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1riWXUnA2k&amp;t=0">00:00:00</a> The Bitcoin Civil War is raging, and one participant is Kurt Wuckert Jr., who explains the history of the Bitcoin currency and how it has evolved since its inception. He also discusses the current state of the Bitcoin economy, and how it has affected those who use it.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1riWXUnA2k&amp;t=300">00:05:00</a> The Bitcoin Civil War is a conflict between Bitcoin supporters and detractors. The former argue that the currency and user experience is bad, while the latter argue that the currency is a long-tail marketing ploy.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1riWXUnA2k&amp;t=900">00:15:00</a> Kurt Wuckert Jr. is a computer technician and entrepreneur who has been working in the information technology field for many years. He is also interested in security and politics, and in 2012 he became interested in the theory of money and economics. This led him to become more politically involved and to focus on money and finance as a whole.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1riWXUnA2k&amp;t=1200">00:20:00</a> Kurt Wuckert, Jr. discusses his experience attending a school called Christian Liberty Academy. He elaborates on the importance of epistemological self-consciousness, and how it helped him develop a understanding of sound money politics. He notes that, even at a young age, he had an interest in economics and was always aware of its importance.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1riWXUnA2k&amp;t=1500">00:25:00</a> Bitcoin is a digital currency that has seen its value skyrocket in recent years. However, there is a "bitcoin civil war" going on between different factions of the bitcoin community. Kurt Wuckert Jr. explains the basics of the bitcoin economy and how it is different from traditional currencies. He then tells the story of how he first encountered bitcoin and how it changed his view of economics.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1riWXUnA2k&amp;t=1800">00:30:00</a> The video describes the Bitcoin Civil War, which began in late 2017 when China began to produce superior ASICs that made it difficult for Bitcoin miners to make a profit. The white paper that inspired the creation of Bitcoin explained how proof of work could solve the scalability, speed, and security trilemma. Kurt Wuckert Jr. explains how this system is efficient and how it shows that the creator is powerful.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1riWXUnA2k&amp;t=2100">00:35:00</a> The Bitcoin Civil War video series by Kurt Wuckert Jr. discusses the history of Bitcoin and how it works. The series explains how Bitcoin eliminates the need for middlemen and the waste of resources that comes with them.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1riWXUnA2k&amp;t=2400">00:40:00</a> The video discusses the bitcoin civil war, and how the best bitcoin network is governed by the fittest and most cooperative actors. It also discusses how other data, such as covet 19, can be used to create a global proof of work network.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1riWXUnA2k&amp;t=2700">00:45:00</a> In this video, Kurt Wuckert Jr. outlines the importance of a global, proof-of-work ledger system in order to maintain transparency and prevent abuse of data. He argues that this system is crucial for safeguarding the privacy of individuals, as well as for ensuring that valuable data is not lost or overlooked.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1riWXUnA2k&amp;t=3000">00:50:00</a> The Bitcoin Civil War was fought over disagreements on how to run the network, with proponents of Proof of Work arguing that nodes with the most valid blocks are the ones that should have a say in network governance. The white paper from Satoshi Nakamoto makes it clear that the network should be governed democratically, with nodes able to signal for upgrades.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1riWXUnA2k&amp;t=3300">00:55:00</a> Bitcoin has a two-fold governance system, with miners, who validate transactions, and larger "guard nodes" that help promulgate rules. But a small group of people have successfully inserted themselves as guard nodes and are manipulating the network to their own ends. This has caused the split in the community that led to the activation of SegWit.</p><div id="youtube2-Be4pnFX_2ao" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;Be4pnFX_2ao&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Be4pnFX_2ao?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p></p><p></p><p></p>
