# The Biological Blind Spot in The Great Founder Theory by Samo Burja
####### Blockface

## TOO LONG DIDN'T READ

In essence, while acknowledging the value of Burja's work, Blockface suggests that evolutionary concepts like the Red Queen's Race provide a more fundamental and concise framework for understanding the dynamics of societal change and the role of exceptional individuals within it.

# DIALECTIC

## Thesis
The Great Founder Theory argues that exceptional individuals and the functional institutions they create are primary drivers of social change, rather than impersonal forces or trends.

## Antithesis
The Trends and Forces Theory of History argues that impersonal forces or trends are primary drivers of social change, rather than exceptional individuals and the functional institutions they create.

## Synthesis
Great Founders are enabled by the trend and force of social technologies, which are distinct from material technologies. Social Technologies empower Great Founders to create functional institutions that reshape society.

## Argument

1. Great Founder Theory argues that exceptional individuals and the functional institutions they create are primary drivers of social change, rather than impersonal forces or trends.

2. Social technologies, distinct from material technologies, are crucial for coordinating human action and maintaining institutions. These social technologies amplify the impact of great founders.

3. Blockface suggests that the Red Queen's Race and evolutionary host-parasite co-evolution provide a more fundamental framework for understanding the dynamics described in the Great Founder Theory.

4. The book explores how social technologies regulate disputes, define responsibilities, set expectations, and proceduralize bureaucratic action, promoting different behaviors that reshape society.

5. Blockface critiques the book for not incorporating biology and evolutionary ecology, suggesting that these fields offer valuable insights into the mechanisms of societal change.

6. The concept of "borrowed power" is discussed, with Blockface noting that it's inherently adversarial due to information asymmetries between power lenders and borrowers.

7. Blockface argues that the Red Queen's Race concept from evolutionary biology offers a more concise and fundamental explanation of the dynamics described in the Great Founder Theory, suggesting that the book's 800 pages describe a "lower resolution Red Queen's race."
