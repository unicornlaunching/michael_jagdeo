Instead of waking up at 5:30AM with no coffee, he made coffee at home before seeding his crops. Granted, 5:30AM was still pretty early in the morning, but at least he didn’t have to worry about encountering snakes, bears, and wild hogs on their turf anymore.</p><p>The move to agriculture represented a change in the mode of subsistence, going from Hunter to Crop-Gatherer. The change in food-gathering resulted in a change in God-worship, with man displacing his primitive Forest Gods with Weather Gods like Zeus and his brother Poseidon.</p><p>As man progressed from agricultural-based subsistence to a factory-based way of production, his worship changed again. He went from worshiping Forest Gods to worshiping Nature Gods to Worshiping HIMSELF in the form of Gods that reflected his own interests now that food was no longer an issue; just ask Athena and Ares about their trips to Carthage.</p><p>Over the past 200 years, we’ve moved from a factory-based subsistence powered by mostly humans to a factory-based subsistence powered by humans AND machines.</p><p>And that brings me to the quote we started with…</p><div class="pullquote"><p>Society advances by the number of operations it can perform without thinking.</p><p>- Alfred North Whitehead</p></div><p>Talk to any python programmer and they’ll tell you what they’re automating. The idea of data science is the idea that machines can make profitable decisions afster than their human counterparts…and that’s the apotheosis, the zenith, the pinnacle of capitalism.</p><p>The purpose of capitalism is to create more food with less work.</p><p>The problem is, our systems are now creating more food with less work by removing the primary input: food itself. Our systems are now creating more art with less work by removing the primary input: the artists themselves.</p><p>People ask how we can regulate AI - and that always makes me laugh. We can’t regulate AI anymore than we can regulate nuclear proliferation. After all, we exist in a time of mutually-assured computation. A nation simply cannot afford to ignore semiconductors, because society’s advance by the number of operations it can perform without thinking.</p><p>I hope you enjoy the ride. Hands and feet inside the vehicle at all times.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>The apocalypse wasn’t caused by a pandemic or a nuclear bomb, it was caused when humans ceased to be the sole reason of things and the machines took on a reasoning of their own.</p><p>- Baudrillard h/t Roderick</p></div><div id="youtube2-2U9WMftV40c" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;2U9WMftV40c&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2U9WMftV40c?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><div data-component-name="Twitter2ToDOM" class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/attractfunding/status/1612989706291261440&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Don't be a protein chauvinist. <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>#ChatGPTGOD</span> \n- <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@AhmedMasud</span> ft. <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@KcMagination</span> &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;attractfunding&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;So you want to...&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Wed Jan 11 01:48:08 +0000 2023&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/upload/w_1028,c_limit,q_auto:best/l_twitter_play_button_rvaygk,w_88/bricqnhwkpkwiu0wrd5p&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/MRa24vjMAe&quot;,&quot;alt_text&quot;:null}],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:2,&quot;like_count&quot;:2,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:&quot;https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1612988646679797763/pu/vid/576x360/vgb79-b-sOFfSevC.mp4?tag=12&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"><a class="tweet-link-top" href="https://twitter.com/attractfunding/status/1612989706291261440" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-header-avatar" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/attractfunding.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @attractfunding" loading="lazy"><div class="tweet-header-text"><span class="tweet-author-name">So you want to... </span><span class="tweet-author-handle">@attractfunding</span></div></div><div class="tweet-text">Don't be a protein chauvinist. <span class="tweet-fake-link">#ChatGPTGOD</span>
